# Introduction #

This page gathers cheats for various games that can be employed using Bocfel's cheat system.  In a few places, the value 65535 is used and might appear to be out of place.  When interpreted as a negative value on a 16-bit system (like the Z-machine), 65535 represents -1.  For cheats, however, only unsigned (non-negative) values are used, so for negative values, they must be "encoded" as positive values.

**Please note**: These cheats have not been thoroughly tested, or tested much at all.  Use at your own risk.  There is no guarantee that a game will be completable if these cheats are used.

### Sleepiness ###

```
cheat = freezew:G13:65535
```

### Notes ###
Enchanter periodically reports how hungry and thirsty you are.  If you set the global variables indicating that you are fully sated, these periodic status reports will be gibberish (e.g. "cmhgfh   iseems gdon’t glk jmqcf" instead of "Your mouth is getting rather dry.").  This is because the "print status" messages assume that the value will never be 0, and appears to be harmless.

Similarly, if sleepiness is set to 65535, the message "You are faint from lack of water and the spells you’ve memorized are becoming confused." will periodically appear.  This is, as above, the game not expecting the value 65535, and should be harmless.
## Sorcerer ##

```
### Notes ###
As with Enchanter, Spellbreaker will periodically give status updates which are nonsensical if sleepiness is set to 65535 (e.g. "You are large bird circling the tower and eyeing you suspiciously..").  These appear to be harmless.

### Carrying capacity ###

```
cheat = freezew:Gda:32000
cheat = freezew:G80:32000
```
